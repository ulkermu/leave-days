## The purpose of this project

I'm in the process of developing a system to manage and log the leave days utilized within the company, as well as to add or remove employees as needed. The aim is to transparently track and display which days have been taken off, the remaining leave days available, and to showcase all employees along with their leave days in an organized table format. This will assist the company in efficiently planning and adjusting leave schedules accordingly.

## Deployed on Vercel

http://leave-days.vercel.app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
